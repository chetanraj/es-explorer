# How to contribute

Thank you for stopping by the project!

This tool is not meant to be a replacement for the original documentation, but rather a way to quickly traverse and find what one needs. I value quick clarity and the ability to scan above all else. If you see a way that this can be improved, I appreciate contributions!

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run serve

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## Submitting changes

Please send a pull request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/)).

## Translations

In `src/data`, you'll see the `options.js` file, each feature has an entry. Add or modify an entry.

Test that everything is working by running:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

Thank you!
